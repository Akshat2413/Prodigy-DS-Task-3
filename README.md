# Prodigy-DS-Task-3
As an Intern at Prodigy Infotech, I have completed the task in Jupyter Notebook as per the instructions from Prodigy Infotech i.e, Task - 3: Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
